### Do you use cool scripts to automate portions of your typesetting? Then OptimASS may be for you!

Sometimes those scripts create lines that don't actually get displayed
on the screen but end up taking up lots of space in the resulting
subtitle file and can even bog the renderer down.

OptimASS uses the libASS subtitle renderer to render every subtitle line
and check if it would actually be displayed on playback. Lines that
don't get displayed at all will be removed from your script
automatically!

Given that OptimASS is very early in its life cycle, it likely has a
multitude of bugs and other troubles. Please report all bugs you run
into.

Likewise, it has very few features. If the script turns out to be useful
and desirable, there are many features that may be added.
